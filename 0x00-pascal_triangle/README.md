# 0x00. Pascal's Triangle

This project is an implementation of the Pascal's Triangle in Python. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. It has many interesting properties and applications in mathematics, computer science, and other fields.

## About

The Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers that follows a specific pattern. The numbers at the edges of the triangle are always 1, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The first few rows of the triangle are:

```
      1
     1 1
    1 2 1
   1 3 3 1
  1 4 6 4 1
 1 5 10 10 5 1
```

This project provides a Python implementation of the Pascal's Triangle, allowing you to generate the triangle up to a specified number of rows.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository or download the source code.

## Usage

To use this project, simply run the `pascal_triangle.py` script with the desired number of rows as a command-line argument. For example:

```
python pascal_triangle.py 10
```

This will generate and print the Pascal's Triangle with 10 rows.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of running the `pascal_triangle.py` script with different numbers of rows:

```
$ python pascal_triangle.py 5
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1

$ python pascal_triangle.py 8
        1
       1 1
      1 2 1
     1 3 3 1
    1 4 6 4 1
   1 5 10 10 5 1
  1 6 15 20 15 6 1
 1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1
```
